# Data Processing of the Article: Causal diagramming to improve students’ monitoring accuracy and text comprehension: Effects of diagram standards and self-scoring instructions

This R project reflects the data cleaning and analyses of the article
_Causal diagramming to improve students’ monitoring accuracy and text comprehension: Effects of diagram standards and self-scoring instructions_ 

A snapshot of this project at time of first publication (December 2023) can be found here:

This project will undergo maintenance (e.g., updating used packages) and improvements based on feedback. 

<b>Disclaimer and WARNING:</b>
This project is set-up in such a way that people without any programming background can understand and make use of the R scripts. The scripts are partly VERY long (think about 1500 lines of code).  
<b>I strongly recommend</b> folding the code to make navigation easier by:  
Navigating to Edit->Folding->Collapse All or, depending on the system you are using, with the shortcuts: alt+cmd+o or ctrl+alt+o

## Usage                      

### User who does not need any help with accessing this project/using git/etc.

  - You should be able to run all scripts (in /Scripts/) without pre-installing packages, this will be handled in the first part of each script (if the packages are not yet installed on your system).  
  - To knit the formatted output 'Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring.Rmd' in the main directory, you will need to 
      -  run the two analysis scripts in Scripts/Scripts_Data_Analyses first, <b>OR</b>
      -  run the Package_Installation_Help.R in Scripts/ first.

### User who has git and R installed (or is willing to do that) but needs some more guidance

   -  Make sure you have git, R and RStudio installed

   -  Open the project using Rstudio by selecting <b>file</b> -> <b>new project</b> -> <b>version control</b> -> <b>git</b> and enter https://github.com/SopBra/PROO_Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring

(Choose where you would like to store the project folder).

<b>To inspect the single data cleaning and analysis scripts:</b>

   - Open any of the scripts located in the Scripts folder, (select the whole script) and click Run

<b>To directly inspect the formatted output file of the analysis script:</b>

   - Open the Scripts folder and open + run the 'Package_Installation_Help.R' script
   - Open 'Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring.Rmd' in the main directory and click 'knit'
   
### When none of the above is applicable to you/you start from scratch:

0. Install R and RStudio
1. Go to https://github.com/SopBra/PROO_Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring
2. Press Code --> Download ZIP

<b>Mac OS</b>

3. Move the ZIP file to a place you like and extract it there, for example in a new folder on your Desktop called Cool_RProject
4. Open Rstudio 
5. Press File --> Open project
6. Choose [the place you liked, for example Desktop] --> Cool_RProject --> 0_PROO_Article_2_Standards_and_Self_Scoring.Rproj
7. Press File --> Open File
8. Choose [the place you liked, for example Desktop] --> Cool_RProject --> Scripts --> Package_Installation_Help.R
   -  Mark/select the entire script and press Run (alternative: command/cmd + A and then command/cmd + Enter) --> This will make sure you have all the right packages installed
9. Press File --> Open File  
10.Choose [the place you liked, for example Desktop] --> Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring.Rmd  
11.Press Knit --> This will generate the output as presented in the paper



<b>Windows OS</b>

3. Extract ZIP file to a path (preferably short if you are using Windows), for instance: C:&#92;Cool_RProject\
4. Open Rstudio (default location Windows: "C:&#92;Program Files&#92;RStudio&#92;rstudio.exe")
5. Press File --> Open project
6. Choose C:&#92;Cool_RProject&#92;0_PROO_Article_2_Standards_and_Self_Scoring.Rproj
7. Press File --> Open File
8. Choose C:&#92;Cool_RProject&#92;Scripts&#92;Package_Installation_Help.R
   -  Mark/select the entire script and press Run (alternative: CTRL + Enter) --> This will make sure you have all the right packages installed
9. Press File --> Open File  
10.Choose C:&#92;Cool_RProject&#92;Article_2_Standards_And_Self_Scoring.Rmd  
11.Press Knit (alternative: CTRL + SHIFT + K) --> This will generate the output as presented in the paper

## Roadmap                    

This is the second of four articles related to the effects of different kinds of feedback during a causal diagramming task to improve judgements of (and) text comprehension after reading. Links to the other articles and R projects will be updated upon publication of the research articles.
Article 1 can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2023.102251
